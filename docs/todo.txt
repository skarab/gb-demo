* some bitmap on the "3 planes looking effect" but trying to keep the "3 planes look", maybe sprites too?
* a text scroller (maybe will be on this: ck_gb_aliengirl.gif)
* more transition effects (like erase.c, but without animation), fade in-out too.. etc..

some effects to try:
-starfield
-3d things using sprites on unity exported vertice anim
-panorama scrolling?
-port the horizontal barrel effect (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDcmiFa3K0M)
-tunnel
