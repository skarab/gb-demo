* Critikill "glitch effect": ck_gb_playtime2_glitch.gif & ck_gb_playtime1_glitch.gif
- make sure those pictures are ok in rom
- create the "scanline masked picture version"
- try things

* some bitmap on the "3 planes looking effect" but trying to keep the "3 planes look", maybe sprites too?
* a text scroller (maybe will be on this: ck_gb_aliengirl.gif)
* more transition effects (like erase.c, just explode tiles or something), maybe fade in-out too..

some effects to try:
-tunnel
-3d things using sprites on vertex
-more palette scroll effects, if Critikill make good picts
-panorama scrolling?
-maybe port the horizontal barrel effect (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDcmiFa3K0M)
