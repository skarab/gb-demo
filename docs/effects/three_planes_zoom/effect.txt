This simulate a three planes zooming.

The GB only as two planes, one real plane and the window.
The first two planes are emulated, its a code generated pattern.

The window plane is a picture, which should look similar to the other (to get a real 3 planes effect)...

I'd the idea to add credits on it, dont know, or maybe greatings but this will make a lot of pictures...
